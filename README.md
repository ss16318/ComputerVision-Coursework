# Computer Vision Coursework

Explored the field of computer vision in 5 tasks:

Task 1: Image data was colected and prepared for processing

Task 2: Keypoint correspondence accuracy was compared between manual and automatic methods

Task 3: Camera calibration parameters were derived using measurements from the data

Task 4: Homography and fundamental transformations were estimated in image pairs and their keypoint outlier tolerance recorded

Task 5: Stereo rectification and depth maps were produced using previous results
